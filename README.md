Description:
The following project is a part of TODFEM product. We are trying to achieve a revolutionary battery based product, through research and smart observations. We are hoping to launch a new product by the end of this year. If you want to donate or work on the following project please reach out @

# Display System 

The following Device would show and display vital information about the powerbank, such as showing the battery parcent. 

# Wi-Fi based in depth information and much more
As an esp 32 would power this whole thing, this would be much more powerful mcu, so it can do a lot of things.

# Description of Project 
The project is based on this following research. The following document has all the requirements and safety feature description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Az-Lkp3-ZaH_W2DnesjL1Jfv3u9_doN4sM7y4v4LQA/edit?usp=sharing


# Battery Cell Choices
I took 18650 dimensions 4 batteries of 2600mAh. Also I am currently testing a 10,000mAh Li-Po Battery. If we head into slimmer solutions, we might get into lithium silicon batteries 😝 Cause WHY NOT !

# Battery Parcentage Dillema 🔋

# Feature from previous project 🔑🔐

IDK I am gonna add everything to it lolol 
I have decided to add BLE Keyboard functionality on my project

![BLE Keyboard Bread Board type prototype](BetaCode2/IMG_0332.jpg)
The following image is the working on breadboard codes for the project

# Sensor Lists // Hardware list 🦎
